# What is a user story?
* What makes a great user story
  * A story or user story is a software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language.
* Theme vs Epic vs user story vs task
  * In JIRA Agile, a story is represented as an issue, and individual tasks within the story are represented as sub-tasks.
* User story dos and don’ts
* Advantages of Jira; tips and tricks
* Examples of best in class and ineffective user stories you’ve received, and showing the end result of work in each case

## IN-SESSION EXERCISE YOU’LL LEAD:
* Select a real-life scenario (with sketches/wireframes, if possible)
* Present the concept of the feature
* Participants to write epic and 1-2 supporting user stories
* Participants will share their user stories and compare to real-life stories that were used for an already developed feature.

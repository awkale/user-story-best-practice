# What is a user story?
* What makes a great user story
  * agile development uses four clear delivery vehicles to bring structure to any agile project: user stories, sprints, epics, and versions.
  * The goal of a user story is to deliver a particular value back to the customer.
  * A story or user story is a software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences, ideally using non-technical language.
  * They don't go into detailed requirements. User stories are often written using the following template:
  > As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that I [receive benefit].

  * Let's use a website as a simple example to create a user story.
  > As a customer, I want to be able to create an account so that I can see the purchases I made in the last year to help me budget for next year.

* Version (theme) vs Epic vs user story vs task
  * A version is a set of features and fixes released together as a single update to your product. Assigning issues to versions helps you plan the order in which new features (stories) for your product will be released to your customers.
  * An epic captures a large body of work. It is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. It may take several sprints to complete an epic.
  * In JIRA Agile, a story is represented as an issue, and individual tasks within the story are represented as sub-tasks.
  * A sub-task issue is typically one of many tasks that make up a story (or parent issue).
* User story dos and don’ts
* Advantages of Jira; tips and tricks
* Examples of best in class and ineffective user stories you’ve received, and showing the end result of work in each case

## IN-SESSION EXERCISE YOU’LL LEAD:
* Select a real-life scenario (with sketches/wireframes, if possible)
* Present the concept of the feature
* Participants to write epic and 1-2 supporting user stories
* Participants will share their user stories and compare to real-life stories that were used for an already developed feature.
